# megamekR

This is an *R* package designed to be used to manage MegaMek data for backend use. 
The library itself doesn't *do* anything but provides access to a variety of 
functions to access and work with data. Currently, the only implemented functions
are to read and write planetary data in yaml format.

To install the package, you must have `devtools` installed:

```r
devtools::install_github("megamek/megamekR")
```
